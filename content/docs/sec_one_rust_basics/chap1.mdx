# Rust Development Environment Setup

This chapter will guide you through setting up a complete Rust development environment suitable for Halo2 development. We'll cover everything from installing Rust to configuring your IDE.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have:
- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Administrative access to install software
- Internet connection
- Basic familiarity with command line operations

## Installing the Rust Toolchain

Rust installation is managed through `rustup`, a command line tool that handles Rust versions and associated tools.

### Installing rustup

<Tabs items={["Windows", "macOS/Linux"]}>
  
```bash tab="Windows"
# Download and run rustup-init.exe from https://rustup.rs
# Or use winget:
winget install Rust
```

```bash tab="macOS/Linux"
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

</Tabs>

<Callout>
After installation, you may need to restart your terminal for the changes to take effect.
</Callout>

### Verifying the Installation

Open a new terminal window and run these commands:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
rustup --version
```

You should see output similar to:
```plaintext
rustc 1.82.0 (f6e511eec 2024-10-15)
cargo 1.82.0 (8f40fc59f 2024-08-21)
rustup 1.27.1 (54dd3d00f 2024-04-24)
```

### Updating Rust

To update your Rust installation:

```bash
rustup update
```

## IDE Setup

While you can use any text editor for Rust development, we recommend Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for its excellent Rust support.

### Installing VS Code

1. Download VS Code from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system

### Essential Extensions

Install these VS Code extensions for the best Rust development experience:

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="rust-analyzer"
    href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer"
  >
    The official Rust language server. Provides code completion, go to definition, and more.
  </Card>
  
  <Card
    title="CodeLLDB"
    href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb"
  >
    Debug support for Rust code.
  </Card>
</Cards>

### Recommended VS Code Settings

Create or update your `settings.json` in VS Code with these settings:

```json title="settings.json"
{
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "rust-analyzer.checkOnSave.command": "clippy",
    "rust-analyzer.inlayHints.enable": true,
    "rust-analyzer.inlayHints.typeHints.enable": true,
    "rust-analyzer.inlayHints.parameterHints.enable": true
}
```

## Creating Your First Rust Program

Let's create and run a simple Rust program to verify everything is working correctly.

### Creating a New Project

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
cargo new hello_rust
cd hello_rust
```

This creates a new directory `hello_rust` with this structure:

```plaintext
hello_rust/
├── Cargo.toml
└── src/
    └── main.rs
```

### Understanding Project Files

#### Cargo.toml
This is your project's manifest file. It includes metadata and dependencies:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "hello_rust"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
```

#### src/main.rs
This is your program's entry point:

```rust title="src/main.rs"
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Halo2 learner!");
}
```

### Building and Running

To build and run your program:

```bash
cargo run
```

You should see:
```plaintext
   Compiling hello_rust v0.1.0
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.61s
     Running `target/debug/hello_rust`
Hello, Halo2 learner!
```

<Callout type="info" title="Cargo Commands">
Common Cargo commands:
- `cargo build`: Compiles your project
- `cargo run`: Compiles and runs your project
- `cargo check`: Checks your code for errors without producing an executable
- `cargo test`: Runs tests
</Callout>

## Exercises

1. **Environment Verification**
   - Install Rust and verify the installation
   - Set up VS Code with recommended extensions
   - Create and run a "Hello, World!" program

2. **Cargo Exploration**
   ```bash
   # Try these commands and observe the output
   cargo new exercise_project
   cd exercise_project
   cargo check
   cargo build
   cargo run
   ```

3. **Project Structure**
   - Create a new project
   - Add a function that returns a string
   - Call this function from `main()`
   - Build and run the project

## Common Issues and Solutions

<Callout type="warn" title="Troubleshooting">
Here are some common issues you might encounter:

1. **"Command not found" after installation**
   - Solution: Restart your terminal or add Rust to your PATH

2. **Permission errors during installation**
   - Solution: Use `sudo` on Unix-like systems or run as administrator on Windows

3. **VS Code extensions not working**
   - Solution: Ensure rust-analyzer is properly installed and reload VS Code
</Callout>

## Next Steps

Once you've completed this chapter, you should have:
- A working Rust installation
- A configured development environment
- Successfully created and run your first Rust program
- Basic familiarity with Cargo commands

In the next chapter, we'll dive into Rust's basic syntax and fundamental concepts.
